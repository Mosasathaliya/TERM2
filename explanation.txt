Lesson: Unit 1: Auxiliary Verbs (do, be, have)

---

Lesson: Unit 1: Questions and Negatives
To make questions in simple tenses, use do/does/did before the subject. For negatives, use don't/doesn't/didn't before the main verb. For other tenses, invert the auxiliary verb (be/have) and the subject for questions, or add 'not' after the auxiliary for negatives.

---
