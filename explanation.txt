Lesson: Vocabulary: What's in a Word?
Explanation: This lesson explores different aspects of vocabulary, including parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective), spelling and pronunciation rules, word formation with prefixes and suffixes, and common collocations (words that go together).
Example: 'Act' (verb), 'action' (noun), 'actor' (noun), 'active' (adjective). - 'فعل' (فعل)، 'عمل' (اسم)، 'ممثل' (اسم)، 'نشط' (صفة).
Example: The words 'read' (present) and 'read' (past) are spelled the same but pronounced differently. - كلمتا 'يقرأ' (مضارع) و'قرأ' (ماض) تكتبان بنفس الطريقة ولكن تنطقان بشكل مختلف.
Example: The suffix '-ion' often turns a verb into a noun, e.g., 'decide' -> 'decision'. - اللاحقة '-ion' غالبًا ما تحول الفعل إلى اسم، على سبيل المثال 'يقرر' -> 'قرار'.
Example: The prefix 'un-' often means 'not', e.g., 'happy' -> 'unhappy'. - البادئة 'un-' غالبًا ما تعني 'ليس'، على سبيل المثال 'سعيد' -> 'غير سعيد'.
Example: We say 'drive carefully', not 'drive careful'. (verb + adverb) - نقول 'قُد بحذر'، وليس 'قُد حذر'. (فعل + حال)
Example: Collocation: We 'make a mistake', we don't 'do a mistake'. - تلازم لفظي: نقول 'ارتكب خطأ'، ولا نقول 'فعل خطأ'.
Example: The words 'dear' and 'deer' sound the same but have different meanings (homophones). - كلمتا 'عزيز' و'غزال' لهما نفس النطق ولكن لهما معانٍ مختلفة (متجانسات لفظية).
Example: We say 'strong coffee', not 'powerful coffee'. - نقول 'قهوة قوية'، وليس 'قهوة جبارة'.
Example: Recognizing the part of speech helps you use a word correctly in a sentence. - التعرف على جزء الكلام يساعدك على استخدام الكلمة بشكل صحيح في الجملة.
Example: Keeping a vocabulary notebook with examples is a great way to learn. - الاحتفاظ بدفتر مفردات مع أمثلة هو طريقة رائعة للتعلم.
Story: From a Linguistics Textbook
Summary: Understanding words is complex. A word has a pronunciation and a spelling, which can be different. It also has a part of speech, like 'noun' or 'verb'. For example, 'act' is a verb, but 'action' is a noun. We also combine words in set phrases, or collocations, like 'fast food', not 'quick food'. Knowing these rules makes your English sound natural.
