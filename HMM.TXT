10 Unit 1 It's a wonderful world!
WONDERS OFI don't believe that today's wonders are similar in
kind to the wonders of the Ancient World. They were
all buildings, such as the Pyramids in Egypt, or other
architectural structures. Over the past 10o years,
we have seen amazing technological and scientific
achievements. These are surely our modern wonders.
1
It is everywhere. More than half a billion people use it, and the number
of people who are online increases by 100 million every year. In 1994
there were only a few hundred web pages. Today there are billions.
It has revolutionized the way we live and work. But we are still in the
early days. Soon there will be more and more interactivity between the
user and the website, and we will be able to give instructions using speech.
2
In 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped out of his space capsule onto the
surface of the moon and made his famous statement: 'That's one small
step for a man, one giant leap for mankind'. Since then, there have been
space probes to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and even to the sun. One day, a
space observatory will study how the first stars and galaxies began.
So far, it seems that we are alone in the universe. There are no signs
yet that there is intelligent life outside our own solar system. But who
knows what the future holds?
adidas
HE MODERN WORLD by
Ann
Halliday
3
Surely nothing has done more for the comfort and
happiness of the human race than the advances in health
care! How many millions of people have benefited from
the humble aspirin? How many lives has penicillin saved?
Average life expectancy worldwide has risen dramatically
over the past 100 years, from about 47 years in 1900 to
about 77 years today.
4
We are a world on the move. Airlines carry more than 1.5
billion people to their destinations every year. It is estimated
that, at any one time these days, there are as many people
travelling in aeroplanes as the total number of people who
travelled abroad in the whole of the nineteenth century (but I
have no idea how they worked this out!).
5
It is true that they are now commercialized, and there is
greed and drug abuse. However, it is a competition in which
almost every country in the world takes part. Every four years,
for a brief moment, we see the world come together in peace
and friendship. We feel hope again for the future of mankind.
6
In 1724, Jonathan Swift wrote, 'Whoever makes two blades
of grass or two ears of corn grow where only one grew before
serves mankind better than the whole race of politicians'.
In Europe our farmers have done this. In 1709,
whole villages in France died of hunger. Now
in Europe, we can't eat all the food we produce.
If only politicians could find a way to share
it with those parts of the world where
there is famine.
7 We are still here!
The last wonder of the modern
world is simply that we are still here.
We have had nuclear weapons for
over 50 years that could destroy
the world, but we haven't used
them to do it. This is surely
the greatest wonder
of all.

THE CLOWN
DOCTOR
All over the world, children in hospital are being
treated with a new kind of medicine: laughter.
LUCY is 23 and works for Theodora Children's
Trust. She is one of many clown doctors who
bring a smile to the faces of sick children.
I'm a Theodora clown doctor, I call myself
Dr LooLoo. I spend two days a week in
children's hospitals being extremely silly with
my friend and colleague Dr Chequers. We make funny
faces, tell jokes, and do magic tricks. As I walk into the
wards I blow bubbles, shake hands with the kids, and
make up nonsense songs for those children well
enough to sing. We take special balloons to make
'balloon animals' and tell funny stories about them.
We often meet kids who one week look really sick,
then we go back the next week and they're racing
about yelling 'Hi there, Dr LooLoo! Hi Dr Chequers!
I'm naturally a very cheerful person. I've always
been a clown. In fact my father's a clown and I started
working with him when I was eight years old. I knew it
was just the job for me and I became a clown doctor
because I think it's a great way to cheer up sick,
frightened children in hospital. I wear a fancy coat,
a yellow shirt, and tights with big stripes. Also, I have
a red rubber nose and wear my hair in crazy plaits.
Being a clown in a hospital is very tiring both
physically and emotionally. We have to learn not to
show our feelings, otherwise we'd be useless. Clown
doctors are sensitive but this is not a side most people
see. To the children we're happy all the time. I'm still
learning to allow myself to feel sad occasionally.
There are special kids you get really close to. At the
moment I'm working
with a very sick little
girl from Bosnia who
speaks no English,
so our only common
language is laughter.
She's been in and
out of hospital for
operations so many
times and she's always
on my mind.

At lunchtime we eat in the hospital cafeteria and that's
really useful because we meet the nurses and doctors.
They tell us about particular kids who they think will
benefit from a clown doctor visit. If a child is
frightened, perhaps they're being given an injection or
some nasty medicine - we can distract them so the
nurses can do their job.
About six o'clock Dr Chequers and I take off our
make-up and change our clothes. We're totally
exhausted. Sometimes I have a night out with friends,
it helps me unwind. When I finally fall into bed,
I crash out. At weekends we are often asked to
participate in events to raise money for Theodora
Children's Trust. It's a charity; so we are paid with
the money people give. Being a clown doctor
makes the worries of everyday life seem small.
All in all, I feel privileged to do this job.
L No, I don't. I often go out with friends. I have the
best friends and the best job in the world.

PABLOPICASSO
The painter
HIS EARLY LIFE
On 25 October, 1881, a baby boy
was born in Málaga, Spain. It was a
difficult birth and to help him
breathe, cigar smoke was blown
into his nose! This baby grew up to
be one of the twentieth century's
greatest painters - PABLO PICASSO.
Picasso showed his genius from a
very young age. His first word was
lápiz (Spanish for pencil) and he
could draw before he could talk. He
was the only son in the family, so he
was thoroughly spoiled. He hated
school and often refused to go unless
he was allowed to take one of his
father's pet pigeons with him!
Apart from pigeons, his great love
was art. When in 1891 his father got
a job as an art teacher, Pablo went
with him to work and watched him
paint. Sometimes he was allowed to
help. One evening, his father was
painting a picture of their pigeons
when he had to leave the room.
When he returned, Pablo had
completed the picture. It was so
beautiful and lifelike that he gave
his son his palette and brushes and
never painted again. Pablo was just
thirteen.
HIS LIFE AS AN ARTIST
His genius as an artist was soon
recognized by many people, but
others were shocked by his strange
and powerful paintings. He is
probably best known for his Cubist
pictures. His portraits of people
were often made up of triangles and
squares with their features in the
wrong places. One of his most famous
portraits was of the American writer
Gertrude Stein, who he met after
he'd moved to Paris in 1904.
His work changed ideas about art
around the world, and to millions
of people, modern art means the
work of Picasso. Guernica [below],
which he painted in 1937, records
the bombing of that small Basque
town during the Spanish Civil War,
and is undoubtedly one of the
masterpieces of modern painting.
HIS FINAL YEARS
Picasso married twice and also had
many mistresses. He had four
children. The last, Paloma, was born
in 1949 when he was 68 years old.
At the age of 90 he was honoured
by an exhibition in the Louvre in
Paris. He was the first living artist
to be shown there.
Picasso created over 6,000 paintings,
drawings, and sculptures. Today, a
Picasso costs millions of pounds.
Once, when the French Minister of
Culture was visiting Picasso, the
artist accidentally spilled some
paint on the Minister's trousers.
Picasso apologized and wanted to
pay for them to be cleaned, but the
Minister said, 'Non! Please, Monsieur
Picasso, just sign my trousers!"
Picasso died of heart failure during
an attack of influenza in 1973.

ERNESTHEMINGWAY
The writer
HIS EARLY LIFE
ERNEST HEMINGWAY was one of
the great American writers of the
twentieth century. He was born on
21 July 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois,
the second of six children. His
family was strict and very religious.
His father taught his children a love
of nature and the outdoor life.
Ernest caught his first fish at the
age of three, and was given a
shotgun for his twelfth birthday.
His mother taught him a love of
music and art. At school, he was
good at English and wrote for the
school newspaper. He graduated in
1917, but he didn't go to college. Hе
went to Kansas City and worked as
a journalist for the Star newspaper.
He learned a lot, but left after only
six months to go to war.

HEMINGWAY AND WAR
Hemingway was fascinated by war.
He had wanted to become a soldier,
but couldn't because he had poor
eyesight. Instead, in the First World
War, he became an ambulance
driver and was sent to Italy, where
he was wounded in 1918. After the
war, he went to live in Paris, where
he was encouraged in his work by
the American writer Gertrude Stein.
In the 1930s, he became a war
correspondent in the Spanish Civil
War and World War II. Many of his
books were about war. His most
successful book, For Whom the Bell
Tolls, was written in 1940 and is
about the Spanish Civil War. Another
novel, A Farewell to Arms, is about
the futility of war.
HIS PERSONAL LIFE
Hemingway's success in writing
was not mirrored by similar success
in his personal life. He married four
times. His first wife divorced him in
1927. He immediately married again
and moved to Key West, Florida,
where he enjoyed hunting, fishing,
and drinking, but he also suffered
from depression. This wasn't helped
when, in 1928, his father committed
suicide. Hemingway's health was not
good and he had many accidents.
Two more marriages failed and
he began to drink heavily. In 1954,
he survived two plane crashes.
In October of the same year he
was awarded the Nobel Prize for
literature, but he was too ill to receive
it in person.
HIS FINAL YEARS
His final years were taken up with
health problems and alcohol. He
began to lose his memory and
he couldn't write any more.
On Sunday, 2 July 1961,
For Whom the Bell Tolls Hemingway killed himself with a shotgun, just as
his father had done
before him.

A WORLD GUIDE TO
Good Manners
How not to behave badly abroad
by Norman Ramshaw
Travelling to all corners of the world gets easier and easier. We live in a
global village, but this doesn't mean that we all behave in the same way.
• Greetings
How should you behave when you meet
someone for the first time? An American
or Canadian shakes your hand firmly
while looking you straight in the eyes. In
many parts of Asia, there is no physical
contact at all. In Japan, you should bow,
and the more respect you want to show,
(1). In Thailand, the greeting is made
by pressing both hands together at the
chest, as if you are praying, and bowing
your head slightly. In both countries, eye
contact is avoided as a sign of respect.
이Clothes
Many countries have rules about what
you should and shouldn't wear. In Asian
and Muslim countries, you shouldn't
reveal the body, especially women,
who (2).
In Japan, you should take off your shoes
when entering a house or a restaurant.
Remember to place them neatly
together facing the door you came in.
This is also true in China, Korea,
Thailand, and Iran.
• Food and drink
In Italy, Spain, and Latin America, lunch
is often the biggest meal of the day, and
can last two or three hours. For this
reason many people eat a light breakfast
and a late dinner. In Britain, you might
have a business lunch and do business as
you eat. In Mexico and Japan, (3)
Lunch is a time to relax and socialize,
and the Japanese rarely drink alcohol
at lunchtime. In Britain and the United
States, it's not unusual to have a
business meeting over breakfast, and
in China it's common to have business
banquets, but you shouldn't discuss
business during the meal.
Doing business
In most countries, an exchange of
business cards is essential for all
introductions. You should include your
company name and your position. If
you are going to a country where your
language is not widely spoken, you
can get the reverse side of your card
printed in the local language. In Japan,
you must present your card with both
hands, with the writing facing the
person you are giving it to.
In many countries, business hours
are from 9.00 or 10.00 to 5.00 or 6.00.
However in some countries, such as
Greece, Italy, and Spain, (4) then
remain open until the evening.
Japanese business people consider it
their professional duty to go out after
work with colleagues to restaurants,
bars, or nightclubs. If you are invited,
you shouldn't refuse, even if you don't
feel like staying out late.
EXTRA TIPS
HERE ARE SOME EXTRA TIPS
BEFORE YOU TRAVEL:
1 In many Asian cultures, it is
acceptable to smack your lips
when you eat. It means that the
food is good.
2 In France, you shouldn't sit down
in a café until you've shaken
hands with everyone you know.
3 In India and the Middle East,
you must never use the left hand
(5).
4 In China, your host will keep
refilling your dish unless you lay
your chopsticks across your bowl.
5 Most South Americans and
Mexicans like to stand very close
to the person they're talking to.
You shouldn't back away.
6
7
In Russia, you must match your
hosts drink for drink or they will
think you unfriendly.
In Ireland, social events
sometimes end with singing
and dancing. You may be asked
to sing.
8 In America, you should eat
your hamburger with both hands
and as quickly as possible.
You shouldn't try to have a
conversation until it is eaten.

My kind of holiday
She travels for her job, but when it's her own
holiday, Karen Saunders stays at home.
Karen Saunders has her own travel agency in Mayfair, London
that sends people all over the world on their dream holidays.
She needs to know where she's sending them, so she goes on
working holidays four or five times a year.
My ideal holiday
My ideal holiday has a little bit of
everything. I like lazing on a beach
with a pile of books, but then I get bored and
I need to do something. I love exploring new
places, especially on foot, and nosing around in
churches, shops, museums, and restaurants.
I'm very into cooking, so I love going around
markets and food stores.
However, I must confess that my favourite
'holiday resort' is home. I travel so much in
my job that just waking up in my own bed is
heaven. I potter around the house in my
pyjamas, read the paper, do some gardening,
shop for some food, then make a delicious
meal in the evening.
My business holidays
I have three trips coming up. I'm looking
forward to going to Canada soon, where I'm
staying for four nights at the Ice Hotel. This
is a giant igloo situated in Montmorency Fall
Park, just 20 minutes from downtown Quebec.
It is made from 4,500 tons of snow and 250
tons of ice, and it takes 5 weeks to build.
It will stay open for three months. When the
spring arrives, it will melt. Then it will be built
again for next year - maybe in a different place!
Each room is supplied with a sleeping bag
made from deer skins. The hotel has two art
galleries featuring ice sculptures, and an ice
cinema. It also has a bar where all the drinks
come in glasses made of ice. Of course I'll
visit them all!
In complete contrast to the Ice Hotel, I'm
going to Dubai the following month, to stay
a few days at the spectacular Burj al-Arab,
which means the Arabian Tower. It's shaped
like a giant sail, and it rises dramatically out
of the Arabian Gulf. Each room has sea views.
I really want to try the restaurant in the tube at
the top next to the helipad. Other must-dos
include shopping in the markets, called souks.
(You can buy designer clothes, perfumes, and
spices, but what I want is some gold jewellery.)
I'm also going to visit the camel races.
The next trip, different again, is to Baobab
Rivers, in Selous, Tanzania, for a seven-day safari
and I'm looking forward to a fors1

GL BAL PIZZA
BY CONNIE ODONE
So you thought the hamburger was the world's most popular fast food? After all, McDonald's
Golden Arches span the globe. But no, there is another truly universal fast food, the ultimate
fast food. It's easy to make, easy to serve, much more varied than the hamburger, can be
eaten with the hands, and it's delivered to your front door or served in fancy restaurants.
It's been one of America's favourite foods for over 50 years. It is, of course, the pizza.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF PIZZA
It's kind of silly to talk about the moment when pizza
was 'invented'. It gradually evolved over the years, but
one thing's for certain - it's been around for a very long
time. The idea of using pieces of flat, round bread as
plates came from the Greeks. They called them
'plakuntos' and ate them with various simple toppings
such as oil, garlic, onions, and herbs. The Romans
enjoyed eating something similar and called it 'picea'.
By about 1000 A.D. in the city of Naples, 'picea' had
become 'pizza' and people were experimenting with
more toppings: cheese, ham, anchovies, and finally the
tomato, brought to Italy from Mexico and Peru in the
sixteenth century. Naples became the pizza capital of
the world. In 1889, King Umberto I and
Queen Margherita heard about pizza
and asked to try it. They invited
pizza maker, Raffaele Esposito,
to make it for them. He
decided to make the
pizza like the Italian
flag, so he used red tomatoes, white mozzarella cheese,
and green basil leaves. The Queen loved it and the new
pizza was named 'Pizza Margherita' in her honour.
Pizza migrated to America with the Italians at the
end of the nineteenth century. The first pizzeria in
the United States was opened in 1905 at 531½ Spring
Street, New York City, by Gennaro Lombardi. But the
popularity of pizza really exploded when American
soldiers returned from Italy after World War II and
raved about 'that great Italian dish'. Americans are
now the greatest producers and consumers of pizza
in the world.
PIZZAVIA
1 Americans eat 350 slices of pizza per second.
2 There are 61,269 pizzerias in the United States.
3 Pizza is a $30 billion per year industry.
4 October is national pizza month in the United States.
5 The world's first pizzeria, the Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba,
which opened in Naples in 1830, is still there.
6 Pizza Hut has over 12,000 restaurants and takeaway
outlets in over 90 countries.
7 In America, pepperoni is the favourite topping.
Anchovies is the least favourite.
8 In Japan, eel and squid are favourites.
In Russia it's red herring, salmon, and onions.
9 In Brazil, they like green peas on their pizza.
In Australia the favourites are shrimp and
pineapple.
10 The French love bacon and crème
fraîche on theirs. The English love tuna
and sweetcorn.

To ask about the weather, we can use both questions.
How's the weather
What's the weather like where you are?
2 How...? is also used to ask about people's health and happiness.
Compare:
How's Peter? He's fine.
What's Peter like? He's a nice guy. He's quite tall, has dark hair...
3 How... ? is also used to ask about people's reactions and feelings.
How's your meal?
How's your new job?
142 Grammar Reference 6.1-6.2
6.3 How...? or What... like?
Sometimes we can use What... like? or How...?, but they aren't the
same. What... like? asks for an objective description. How...? asks for
personal feelings. Compare:
How's the party?
What's the party like?
1
It's great!
It's very noisy, but there's lots to eat and drink.
6.4 Verb + -ing or infinitive
Verb patterns p158
6.5 Relative clauses
Relative clauses are used to tell us which person or thing we are
talking about. They make it possible to give more information
about the person or thing being spoken about.
The boy has gone to the beach. (Which boy?)
The boy who lives next door has gone to the beach.
The book is very good. (Which book?)
The book that I bought yesterday is very good.
This is a photo ofthe hotel. (Which hotel?)
This is a photo of the hotel where we stayed.
2 We use who to refer to people (and we can also use that).
The book is about a girl who marries a millionaire.
We use that to refer to things (and we can also use which).
What was the name of the horse that won the race?
UNIT 7
Introduction to the Present Perfect
The same form (have + past participle) exists in many European
languages, but the uses in English are different. In English, the Present
Perfect is essentially a present tense, but it also expresses the effect of
past actions and activities on the present.
PAST PRESENT PERFECT PRESENT
Present Perfect means 'before now. The Present Perfect does not
express when an action happened. If we say the exact time, we have to
use the Past Simple.
In my life, I have travelled to all seven continents.
I travelled around Africa in 1998.
7.1 The Present Perfect
Form
Positive and negative

3 When who or that is the object of a relative clause, it can be left out.
The person you need to talk to is on holiday.
The book I bought yesterday is very good.
Question
How long have we
But when who or that is the subject of a relative clause, it must be
included.

I want a computer that is easy to use.
How long has she

4 Which can be used to refer to the whole previous sentence or idea.
I passed my driving test on my first attempt, which surprised
everyone.
Short answer
Have you always lived in Budapest? Yes, I have.
No, I haven't.
Jane can't come to the party, which is a shamе.
5 We use whose to refer to someone's possessions.
That's the woman whose dog ran away.
That's the man whose wife won the lottery.
6 We can use where to refer to places.
The hotel where we stayed was right on the beach.
We went back to the place where we first met.
6.6 Participles
Participles after a noun define and identify in the same way as relative
clauses.
That woman driving the red Porsche is my aunt.
The men seen outside were probably the thieves.
Use
The Present Perfect expresses:
1 an action that began in the past and still continues (unfinished
past).
We've lived in the same house for 25 years.
Peter's worked as a teacher since 2000.
How long have you known each other?
They've been married for 20 years.
Note
Many languages express this idea with a present tense, but in
English this is wrong.
Peter has been a teacher for ten years. NOT Peter is a teacher for
ten years.
These time expressions are common with this use.
two years 1970
a month the end of the class
for a few minutes since August half an hour 8 o'clock
ages Christmas
We use for with a period of time and since with a point in time.
Grammar Reference 6.3-7.1 143
2 an experience that happened at some time in one's life. The action
is in the past and finished, but the effects of the action are still felt.
When the action happened is not important.
I've been to the United States. (I still remember.)
She's written poetry and children's stories. (in her writing career)
Have you ever had an operation? (at any time in your life up
to now)
How many times has he been married? (in his life)
The adverbs ever, never, and before are common with this use.
Have you ever been to Australia?
I've never tried bungee jumping.
I haven't tried sushi before.
Questions and answers about definite times are expressed in the
Past Simple.
When did you go to the United States?
Was her poetry published while she was alive?
I broke my leg once, but I didn't have to stay in the hospital.
2 We can see that the Present Perfect refers to indefinite time and
the Past Simple refers to definite time by looking at the time
expressions used with the different tenses.
Present Perfect - indefinite

Past Simple - definite

Workbook p45 Further practice of been and gone
7.2 Present Perfect or Past Simple?
1 The Present Perfect is for unfinished actions. The Past Simple is for
completed actions. Compare:
Present Perfect
I've lived in Texas for six years.
(I still live there.)
I've written several books.
(I can still write some more.)
144 Grammar Reference 7.2-7.4
Past Simple
I lived in Texas for six years.

The uses are the same in the passive as in the active.
Two million cars have been produced so far this year. (unfinished past)
Has she ever been made redundant? (past experience)
'Have you heard? Two hundred homes have been washed away by a tidal
wave!' (present importance)
7.4 Phrasal verbs
There are four types of phrasal verbs. Types 1, 2, and 3 can be literal or
idiomatic. Type 4 are nearly always idiomatic.
Type 1
Verb + particle (no object)
a He put on his coat and went out.
b I didn't put enough wood on the fire and it went out.
In a, the verb and particle are used literally. In b, they are used
idiomatically. Go out means stop burning.
Examples with literal meaning:
Sit down.
She stood up and walked out.
Please go away.
She walked right past the store without noticing it.
Examples with idiomatic meaning:
The marriage didn't work out. (= succeed)
Our plans fell through. (= fail)
Type 2
Verb + particle + object (separable)
a I put up the picture.
b I put up my sister for the night.
In a, the verb and particle are used literally. In b, they are used
idiomatically. Put up means give someone food and a place to sleep,
usually for the night or a few days.
Type 2 phrasal verbs are separable. The object (noun or pronoun) can
come between the verb and the particle.
I put up the picture.
I put the picture up.
I put up my sister.
I put my sister up.
If the object is a pronoun, it always comes between the verb and the
particle.
I put it up. NOT Hput up it.
I put her up. NOT Iput up her.
Examples with a literal meaning:
The waiter took away the plates.
Don't throw it away.
They're pulling that old building down.
Examples with an idiomatic meaning:
I put off the meeting. (= postpone)
Don't let me down. (= disappoint)
Type 3
Verb + particle + object (inseparable)
a She came across the room.
b She came across an old friend while she was out shopping.
In a, the verb and particle are used literally. In b, they are used
idiomatically. Come across means find by accident.
Type 3 phrasal verbs are inseparable. The object (noun or pronoun)
always comes after the particle.
NOT She came an old friend across: or She came her aeross:
Examples with a literal meaning:
I'm looking for Jane.
They ran across the park.
We drove past them.
Examples with an idiomatic meaning:
I'll look after it for you. (= care for)
She takes after her father. (= resemble in features, build, character, or
disposition)
He never got over the death of his wife. (= recover from)
Type 4
Verb + particle + particle
I get along very well with my boss.
I'm looking forward to it.
How can you put up with that noise?
Type 4 phrasal verbs are nearly always idiomatic. The object cannot
change position. It cannot come before the particles or between the
particles.
NOT F'm looking forward it to.
UNIT 8
Introduction to conditionals
There are many different ways of making sentences with if. It is
important to understand the difference between sentences that express
real possibilities, and those that express unreal situations.
Real possibilities
Ifit rains, we'll stay hoте.
(if+ Present Simple + will)
If you've finished your work, you can go home.
(if+ Present Perfect + modal auxiliary verb)
Ifyou're feeling ill, go home and get into bed.
(if+ Present Continuous + imperative)
Unreal situations
You would understand me better if you came from my country.
(would + if + Past Simple)
If I were rich, I wouldn't have any problems.
(if+ were+ would)
If I stopped smoking, I could run faster.
(if+ Past Simple + modal auxiliary verb)
There are several patterns that you need to know to understand the
variations. Note that a comma is usual when the if clause comes first.
Form
8.1 First conditional
if+ Present Simple + will
Positive
If I find your wallet, I'll let you know.
We'll come and see you on Sunday if the weather's good.
Negative
You won't pass the test ifyou don't study.
If you lose your ticket, you won't be able to go.
Question
What will you do if you don't find a job?
If there isn't a hotel, where will you stay?
Note that we do not usually use will in the if clause.
NOT fyou will leave now, you'll catch the train.
If I'll go out tonight, I'll give you a call.
If can be replaced by unless (= if ... not) or in case (= because of the
possibility...).
Unless I hear from you, I'll come at 8.00.
I'll take my umbrella in case it rains.
Use
1 First conditional sentences express a possible condition and its
probable result in the future.
Condition (ifclause)
If I find a jumper in your size,
If you can't do the homework,
Ifyou can find my purse,
Result (result clause)
I'll buy it for you.
give me a call.
Ifyou've never been to Wales,
I might buy you an ice-cream.
you should try to go there one day.
2 We can use the first conditional to express different functions (all of
which express a possible condition and a probable result).
If you do that again, I'll kill you! (a threat)
Careful! If you touch that, you'll burn yourself! (a warning)
I'll post the letter ifyou like. (an offer)
If you lend me £100, I'll love you forever. (a promise)
Grammar Reference 8.1 145
8.2 Time clauses
Conjunctions of time (when, as soon as, before, until, after) are not
usually followed by will. We use a present tense even though the time
reference is future.
I'll call you when I get home.
As soon as dinner is ready, I'll give you a call.
Can I have a word with you before I go?
Wait until I come back.
We can use the Present Perfect if it is important to show that the action
in the time clause is finished.
When I've read the book, I'll lend it to you.
I'll go home after I've done the shopping.
8.3 Zero conditional
Zero conditional sentences refer to 'all time, not just the present or
future.They express a situation that is always true. If means when or
whenever.
If you spend over £50 at that supermarket, you get a five per cent
discount.
Form
8.4 Second conditional
if + Past Simple + would
Positive
If I won some money, I'd go around the world.
My father would kill me if he could see me now.
Negative
I'd give up my job if I didn't like it.
If I saw a ghost, I wouldn't talk to it.
Question
What would you do ifyou saw someone shoplifting?
If you needed help, who would you ask?
Note that was can change to were in the condition clause.
8.5 First or second conditional?
Both conditionals refer to the present and future. The difference is
about probability, not time. It is usually clear which conditional to
use. First conditional sentences are real and possible; second
conditional sentences express situations that will probably never
happen.
If I lose my job, I'll... (My company is doing badly. There is a strong
possibility of being made redundant.)
If I lost my job, I'd... (I probably won't lose my job. I'm just
speculating.)
If there is a nuclear war, we'll all... (Said by a pessimist.)
If there was a nuclear war, ... (But I don't think it will happen.)
would
Notice the use of would in the following sentences:
She'd look better with shorter hair. (= If she cut her hair, she'd look
better.)
would to express preference
I'd love a cup of coffee.
Where would you like to sit?
I'd rather have coffee, please.
I'd rather not tell you, if that's all right.
What would you rather do, stay in or go out?
would to expressarequest
Would you open the door for me?
Would you mind lending me a hand?
If I
If he were rich, wouldn't have to work. he
Use
1
2
3
We use the second conditional to express an unreal situation and
its probable result. The situation or condition is improbable,
impossible, imaginary, or contrary to known facts.
If Iwere the president of my country, I'd increase taxes. (But it's not
very likely that I will ever be the president.)
If my mother was still alive, she'd be very proud. (But she's dead.)
If Ted needed money, I'd lend it to him. (But he doesn't need it.)
Other modal verbs are possible in the result clause.
I could buy some new clothes if I had some money.
If I saved a little every week, I might be able to save up for a car.
Ifyou wanted that job, you'd have to apply very soon.
If I were you, I'd... is used to give advice.
If I were you, I'd apologize to her.
I'd take it easy for a while ifI were you.

UNIT 9
Modal verbs
Modal verbs can express ability, obligation, permission, and
request. They can also express the idea of probability or
how certain a situation is. There is an introduction to
modal auxiliary verbs on p139.
1
Modal verbs of probability
9.1 Expressing possibility/probability: the present/future
Must and can't express the logical conclusion of a
situation: must = logically probable; can't = logically
improbable. We don't have all the facts, so we are not
absolutely sure, but we are pretty certain.
He must be exhausted. He can't even stand up.
Sue can't have a ten-year-old daughter! Sue's only 24!
He's in great shape, even though he must be at least 60!
A walk in this weather! You must be joking!
Is there no answer? They must be in bed. They can't be
out this late!
2 Could and may/might express possibility in the
present or future. May/Might + not is the negative.
Couldn't is rare in this use.
He might be lost.
They could move to a different place.
Dave and Beth aren't at home. They could be at the
concert, I suppose.
We may go to Greece for our vacation. We haven't
decided yet.
Take your umbrella. It might rain later.
I might not be able to come tonight. I might have to
work late.
The continuous infinitive
Must/could/can't/might + be +-ing make the continuous
form in the present.
Peter might be working late.
They can't be working very hard.
Compare:
'John's grass is lovely. He must cut it regularly.' (habit)
'What's John doing in the garden?" 'He might be cutting the
grass.' (now)
9.2 Expressing possibility/probability:
the past
The perfect infinitive
Must/could/can't/might + have + past participle express
degrees of probability in the past.
He must have been exhausted.
She can't have told him about us yet.
He might have got lost.
They could have moved house.
The continuous infinitive
Must/could/can't/might + have + been + -ing make the
continuous form in the past.
She must have been joking.
They can't have been trying very hard.
He could have been lying to you.
Workbook p57 Further practice of the
continuous infinitive
9.3 Asking about possibilities
To ask about possibility/probability we usually use Do you think ...? Question
forms with modal verbs of probability are unusual.
'Do you think she's married?' 'She can't be.?
'Where do you think he's from?'
'Do you think they've arrived yet?
9.4 So do I! Neither do I!
'He might be Spanish or Portuguese.'
'They may have. Or they might have got
stuck in the traffic.
When we agree or disagree using So.../Neither... I, we repeat the auxiliary verbs.
If there is no auxiliary, use do/does/did. Be careful with sentence stress.
AGREEING DISAGREEING
I like ice-cream. So do I. I don't like Mary.
I'm wearing jeans. So am I.
I can swim. So can I.
I went out. So did I.
We're going now.
I can speak Polish.
I haven't been skiing.
I do.
We aren't.
I can't.
I have.
I don't like working.
I can't drive.
I haven't been to Paris
Neither do I.
Neither can I.
Neither have I.
I like blue cheese.
I saw Pat yesterday.
I'm going to have
some coffee.
I don't.
I didn't.
I'm not.
9.5 too and either/neither
We express that we have the same ideas as somebody else by using too and
either/neither.With too and either we repeat the auxiliary verbs or, if there is no
auxiliary, use do/does/did.
I like ice-cream,
I have always studied hard.
I don't like working.
I can't play a musical instrument.
I do, too./ Me too.
I have, too./Me too.
I don't, either. / Me neither.
I can't, either. / Me neither.
Grammar Reference 9.1-9.5 147
UNIT 10
Continuous forms
Remember, the following ideas are expressed by all
continuous forms:
1 activity in progress.
Be quiet! I'm thinking.
I was having a shower when the phone rang.
I've been working since 9 o'clock this morning.
2 temporary activity.
We're staying with friends until we find a place of our
own.
We've been living with them for six weeks.
3 possibly incomplete activity.
I'm writing a report. I have to finish it by tomorrow.
Who's been eating my sandwich?
Form
Workbook p63 Further practice of simple and
continuous forms
10.1 Present Perfect Continuous
Positive and negative
2 a past activity that has causedapresent result.
I've been working all day. (I'm tired now.)
Have you been crying? (Your eyes are red.)
Roger's been cutting the grass. (I can smell it.)
The past activity might be finished or it might not. The context usually makes
this clear.
Look out ofthe window! It's been snowing! (It has stopped snowing now.)
I've been writing this book for two years. (It still isn't finished.)
I'm covered in paint because I've been decorating the bathroom. (It might be
finished or it might not. We don't know.)
10.2 Present Perfect Simple or Continuous?
1 The simple expresses a completed action.
2
I've painted the kitchen, and now I'm doing the bathroom.
The continuous expresses an activity over a period and things that happened
during the activity.
I've got paint in my hair because I've been decorating.
Because the simple expresses a completed action, we use it if the sentence gives
a number or quantity. Here, the continuous isn't possible.
I've been reading all day. I've read ten chapters.
She's been eating ever since she arrived. She's eaten ten biscuits already.

Use
We use the Present Perfect Continuous to express:
1
an activity that began in the past and is continuing now.
I've been studying English for three years.
How long have you been working here?
Sometimes there is no difference between the simple
and the continuous.
I've played
I've been playing the piano since I was a boy.
If the continuous is possible, English has a preference
for using it.
The continuous can sometimes express a temporary
activity, and the simple a permanent state.
I've been living in this house for the pastfew months.
(temporary)
I've lived here all my life. (permanent)
Remember that state verbs rarely take the continuous
form (see 2.3 p136).
I've had this book for ages.
I've always loved sunny days.
148 Grammar Reference 10.1-10.3
Some verbs don't have the idea of a long time, for example, find, start, buy, die, lose, break, stop. These verbs are more usually found in the simple.
Some verbs have the idea of a long time, for example, wait, work, play, try,
learn, rain. These verbs are often found in the continuous.
I've cut my finger. (One short action.)
I've been cutting firewood. (Perhaps over several hours.)
10.3 Time expressions
Here are some time expressions often found with certain tenses.
Past Simple
I lived in Chicago for six years.
I saw Jack two days ago.
They met during the war.
She got married while she was at university.
Present Perfect
We've been married for ten years.
They've been living here since June.
She hasn't been working since their baby was born.
Future
We're going on vacation for a few days.

Question words
Look at the questions. Notice that What, Which, and Whose can
combine with a noun and How can combine with an adjective or an
adverb.
What kind of music do you like?
What size shoe do you wear?
What colour are your eyes?
Which pen do you want?
Which way is it to the station?
Whose book is this?
How much do you weigh?
How many brothers and sisters do you have?
How many times have you been on a plane?
How much homework do you get every night?
How tall are you?
How often do you go to the dentist?
How long does it take you to get to school?

2
11.1 Indirect questions
Indirect questions have the same word order as the positive and
there is no do/does/did.
Tom lives in California.
Do you know where Tom lives?
NOT De you know where does Tom live?
We often make direct questions into indirect questions to make
them sound 'softer' or more polite.
Direct question
What time do the banks close?
Indirect question
Could you tell me
Do you know
Do you happen to know
Have you any idea
Do you remember
Would you mind telling me
what time the banks close?
If there is no question word, use if or whether.
I don't know ifI'm coming or not.
I wonder whether it's going to rain.
Here are some more expressions that introduce indirect questions:
I don't know
I wonder
I can't remember
I've no idea
I'd like to know
I'm not sure
how long the journey takes.
11.2 Question tags
Form
1 Question tags are very common in spoken English. The most
common patterns are:
positive sentence - negative tag
You're Jenny, aren't you?
or negative sentence - positive tag
It isn't a very nice day, is it?
2 We repeat the auxiliary verb in the tag. If there is no auxiliary, use
do/does/did.
You haven't been here before, have you?
You can speak French, can't you?
We should take the dog out, shouldn't we?
Banks close at four, don't they?
She eats meat, doesn't she?
You went to bed late, didn't you?
Note
For negative question tags with I'm...,use aren't.
I'm late, aren't I? NOT late, am't ?
But,
I'm not late, am I? NOT I'm not late, aren't I?
3 Notice the meaning of Yes and No in answer to question tags.
Use
You're coming, aren't you?' Yes. (= I am coming.)
'No.' (= I'm not coming.)
We use question tags to keep a conversation going by involving
listeners and inviting them to participate.
The meaning of a question tag depends on how you say it.
A question tag with rising intonation is like a real question -
it is asking for confirmation. It means 'I'm not sure, so I'm
checking. The speaker thinks he/she knows the answer, but isn't
absolutely certain.
Your name's Abigail, isn't it?
You're in advertising, aren't you?
You work in the city, don't you?
A question tag with falling intonation isn't really a question at all -
it is a way of making conversation. It means 'Talk to me. The
speaker expects people to agree with him/her.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
It's wonderful weather for swimming, isn't it?
That was a great concert, wasn't it?
You haven't been here before, have you?
Note
We can also use question tags with negative sentences to make a
polite request for information or help.
You couldn't lend me your car this evening, could you?

12.1 Tense changes in reported statements

back' if the reporting verb is in the past tense (e.g.,said, told).
2
Present
Present Perfect
Past
Past
Past Perfect
Past Perfect
'I'm going. He said he was going.
'She's passed her test. He told me she had passed her test.
'My father died when I was six. She said her father had died when
she was six.
The verb also moves 'one tense back' when we are reporting
thoughts and feelings.
I thought she was married, but she isn't.
I didn't know he was a teacher. I thought he worked in a bank.
I forgot you were coming. Never mind. Come in.
I hoped you would call.
There is no tense change if:
- the reporting verb is in the present tense (e.g. says, asks).
'The train will be late. He says the train will be late.
'I come from Spain. She says she comes from Spain.
- the reported speech is about something that is still true.
'Rain forests are being destroyed.'
She told him that rain forests are being destroyed.
'I hate football'
I told him I hate football.
Some modal verbs change.
can
will
may
could
would
might
'She can type well. He told me she could type well.
'I'll help you. She said she'd help me.
'I may come. She said she might come.
Other modal verbs don't change.
'You should go to bed. He told me I should go to bed.
'It might rain. She said she thought it might rain.
Must stays as must, or changes to had to.
'I must go!' He said he must/had to go.
12.2 Reporting verbs
There are many reporting verbs.
We rarely use say with an indirect object (i.e., the person spoken to).
She said she was going. NOT Shesaid to me shewas going.
Tell is always used with an indirect object in reported speech.
She told
me
the doctor
us
her husband
the news.
We can use that after say and tell.
He told her (that) he would be home late.
She said (that) sales were down from last year.
Many verbs are more descriptive than say and tell, for example, explain,
interrupt, demand, insist, admit, complain, warn.
He
explained
complained
admitted
that he would be home late.
that sales were down that year.
Sometimes we report the idea, rather than the actual words.
'I'll lend you some money. He offered to lend me some money.
'I won't help you. She refused to help me.
1
12.3 Reported questions
The word order in reported questions is different in reported
speech. There is no inversion of subject and auxiliary verb and
there is no do/does/did. This is similar to indirect questions (see
p149).
'Why have you come here?' I asked her why she had come here.
'What time is it?' He wants to know what time it is.
'Where do you live?' She asked me where I lived.
Note
We do nott use a question mark inareported question.
We do not use say in reported questions.
He said, 'How old are you?' He asked me how old I am.
2 If there is no question word, use if or whether.
if She wants to know whether she should wear a dress.
12.4 Reported commands, requests, etc.
1 For reported commands, requests, offers, and advice, we use
verb + person + to + infinitive.
They told us to go away.
They asked me to look after their cat.
He urged the teachers to go back to work.
She persuaded me to have my hair cut.
I advised the President to leave immediately.
Say is not possible. Use ask, told, etc.
2 For negative commands, use not before to.
He told me not to tell anyone.
The police warned people not to go out.
3 We use tell for reported statements and reported commands, but
the form is different.
Reported statements
He told me that he was going.
They told us that they were going abroad.
She told them what had been happening.
Reported commands
He told me to keep still.
The police told people to move on.
My parents told me to clean up my room.
We use ask for reported commands and reported questions, but
the form is different.
Reported commands
I was asked to attend the interview.
He asked me to open my suitcase.
She asked me not to leave.
Reported questions
He asked me what I did for a living.
I asked her how much the rent was.
She asked me why I had come.

Lucy and Pam's letters
Here are Lucy and Pam's letters to 'Susie's Problem Page.
Dear Susie,
I am 16 years old and totally depressed. I'm in love with
Leon Rossi, the film star. I think about him night and day.
I just sit in my room and watch videos of his films over and
over again. I've written hundreds of letters to him and sent
emails to his fan club, but all I get back are autographed
photos. I dream that one day I'll meet him and that he'll
feel the same way about me. My friends think I'm crazy, so
I don't see them any more. I can't concentrate on my
homework, and I have exams next month, I've tried to talk
to my mum and dad, but they're both solicitors and much
too busy to listen to mе.
Please, please help me! I'm desperate. I'm thinking of
running away to Hollywood to meet him.
Yours in misery,
Lucy

Dear Susie,
I'm almost too tired to write, but I have no one to turn to.
I've been married for three years and everything was just
fine until a year ago when Brian, my husband, lost his job.
He became depressed, and because he has nothing to do,
he just goes over to his mother's house and spends all day
with her. He says he's worried about her because she
lives alone.
I'm a nurse at a hospital. I'm exhausted after work, but
when I get home I have to cook and clean. Brian refuses to
cook or do housework - he says it's boring and gets angry
with me if I ask him to do anything around the house. His
whole personality has changed - we don't communicate any
more. We're always short of money and I'm worried that he
might have a gambling problem. I found hundreds of lottery
tickets in a drawer yesterday, but I haven't said anything
about it.
What can I do? I still love him. We were hoping to start a
family soon, but now I'm not so sure this is a good idea.
Yours sincerely,
